# Build the iTOL_PhylogeneticTree in Fig.1
Upload the [TreeFile.nwk](https://github.com/DOieGYuan/DPRS_with_HMs/blob/master/Data/iTOL_PhylogeneticTree/TreeFile.nwk) file onto the [iTOL online system](https://itol.embl.de/) to construct a phylogenetic tree. 
Refer to the [annotation template](https://itol.embl.de/help/dataset_binary_template.txt) provided by iTOL, we get **[dataset_binary_functional_genes.txt](https://github.com/DOieGYuan/DPRS_with_HMs/raw/master/Rawdata/Metagenome/iTOL_PhylogeneticTree/dataset_binary_functional_genes.txt)**  
Refer to the [annotation template](https://itol.embl.de/help/dataset_color_strip.txt) provided by iTOL, we get **[dataset_color_strip_LDA_group.txt](https://github.com/DOieGYuan/DPRS_with_HMs/blob/master/Rawdata/Metagenome/iTOL_PhylogeneticTree/dataset_color_strip_LDA_group.txt)**  

Draw the file to the iTOL tree decorating window to activate this annotation.  

Here, we get **Fig.1** (Functional microbes inhabiting DPRS).
